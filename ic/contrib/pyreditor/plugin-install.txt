To install PyReditor as a Boa plugin do the following:

1. Copy everything but Pyreditor.Plug-in.py to Boa\pyreditor, i.e.,
   create pyreditor folder at Boa's root folder and copy the files
   there.
2. Copy Pyreditor.Plug-in.py to Boa's plugin directory.

Note: If Boa is open, it needs to be restarted for the PyReditor
to be accessible from the Tools menu.
